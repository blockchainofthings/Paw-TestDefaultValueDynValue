# Test Default Value Paw Extension

This is a Dynamic Value Paw extension that has been created to demonstrate a bug associated with default values of input
 fields of dynamic values.

## Usage

Create a new request, add a custom header to it (e.g. 'X-Test') and assign this dynamic value as its value.

The value returned by the dynamic value is a JSON object containing the dynamic value's fields with their corresponding
 currently assigned values, so it is easy to follow what is going on.
